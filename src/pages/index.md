    SMACK provides a powerful solution to manage your GRC requirements making
    those in risk, compliance and controls more efficient and effective in their
    positions. Created by risk, audit and compliance professionals, we began
    with the most important feature - Reporting. Powerful, dynamic
    multi-dimensional reporting. As professionals in this field, we knew we had
    to get the reporting right or nothing else would really matter. SMACK makes
    it easy for you to get the data you need from system to attain insightful
    understanding of your risk and control environment that will be valuable to
    you in your role and also to a broad range of stakeholders. 

    Besides being the most customizable (more on this below) and powerful
    solution in the industry, it is also the highest value offering in the
    industry. There are no separate or additional charges for additional
    modules. All modules are included. Furthermore, you can outright buy the
    SMACK application rather than "pay-as-go" like a traditional SaaS pricing
    model. It still lives in the cloud and the only ongoing cost you have is for
    the Quick Base platform.

  SMACK is built on the popular Quick Base platform which is used by more than
  half of the Fortune 100. Because SMACK is built on Quick Base, you will have

  values, automation and notifications. You can also add whole new modules to
  SMACK quickly and easily. If you are savvy enough to build a fancy
  spreadsheet, chances are you can pick up Quick Base in no time. The Quick Base
  University, online resources and the abundance of Quick Base consultants out
  there can help you achieve your vision if by chance there is functionality you
  want to add to SMACK. SMACK is also fast to implement, includes powerful
  dynamic reporting and is the #1 value in the industry.
