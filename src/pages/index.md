  description: >-
    SMACK provides a powerful solution to manage your GRC requirements making
    those in risk, compliance and controls more efficient and effective in their
    positions. Created by risk, audit and compliance professionals, we began
    with the most important feature - Reporting. SMACK included powerful,
    dynamic multi-dimensional reporting. As professionals in this field, we knew
    we had to get the reporting right or nothing else would really matter. SMACK
    makes it easy for you to get the data you need from system to drive
    insightful perspectives of your risk and control environment that will be
    useful to you in your role and also to a broad range of stakeholders. 

    Besides being the most customizable (more on this below) and powerful
    solution in the industry, it is also the highest value offering in the
    industry. There are no separate or additional charges for additional
    modules. All modules are included. Furthermore, you can buy the SMACK app
    rather than "pay-as-go" like a traditional SaaS pricing model. It still
    lives in the cloud and all you have to pay for ongoing is the Quick Base
    platform.
