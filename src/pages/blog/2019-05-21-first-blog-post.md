Join us for the Institute of Internal Auditors International Conference in July 2019, where we will be introducing SMACK to the audit community. 

The IIA's 2019 International Conference will be held 7-10 July in Anaheim, CA. 

Internal auditors from all over the globe will converge on Southern California to gain new perspectives, insights, and best practices relevant to all levels and industries.

With a theme of "A Vibe All Its Own," the 2019 IIA International Conference will deliver a program that delves into timely issues impacting the profession. On top of earning CPEs, you will have the opportunity to network with fellow auditors from other countries, share ideas, challenges and solutions, and hear from global leaders on topics that apply across the board.

From 8–10 November 1942, The IIA held its first annual conference in New York City. Since then, this world-class event has been held in more than 50 locations worldwide and attracts over 2,500 attendees annually. The IIA’s International Conference showcases the best the profession has to offer and provides participants from around the world with an understanding of the latest developments in internal auditing.

Today, the International Conference is the premier event for internal auditors who want to hear powerful keynote speakers and international presenters representing the global internal audit profession. Attendees are presented with a number of concurrent sessions on today’s current issues and trends, industry best practices seeking to address common challenges, and knowledge-sharing opportunities. The overall experience enhances professional development, provides engaging peer-to-peer networking, affords access to key service firms and vendors, and much more.

The event has been held in all corners of the globe including Argentina, Australia, Canada, France, Israel, Malaysia, the Netherlands, South Africa, United Kingdom, and the United States, at state-of-the-art convention centers and hotels featuring the most sophisticated facilities.
