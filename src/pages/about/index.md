title: About SMACK GRC
mainDescription: >-
  SMACK GRC was created by a team of audit, risk and compliance professionals
  after noticing a need in the market for a flexible, easy to use solution to
  fulfill GRC requirements. Having been in the industry for many years and never
  having found a GRC application that was satisfying, the SMACK GRC team set off
  to create their own system that could be used for their own organizations and
  also to share with the Risk, Compliance and Audit community. Offering a
  product with the highest quality and wide reaching functionality and at a
  price point for organizations of all sizes is the primary objective of the
  SMACK GRC team.

      owners or risk owners.
