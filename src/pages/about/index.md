title: About SMACK GRC
mainDescription: >-
  SMACK GRC was created by Jeff Moore after noticing a need in the market for a
  flexible, easy to use solution to GRC needs. Having been in the industry for
  10+ years and never having found a GRC software that had all the functionality
  he needed, Jeff set off to create his own application that he could use in his
  organization and also to share with the Risk, Compliance and Audit community.
  Primary functionality that was key for SMACK: 


  * Notifications - SMACK GRC helps organizations stay compliant with various
  standards and regulations by notifying control and action assignees
  periodically when their controls and actions are due. 

  * Controls Assessments/surveys - can be used by auditors, control owners or
  3rd parties to quickly assess controls.

  * Dynamic, flexible reporting - an application is only as valuable as the
  understanding that can be gathered from it.
