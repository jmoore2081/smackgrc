        * SOX has evolved over the last number of years as the regulators,
        businesses and auditors have matured. Never has it been more important
        to ensure that evidence for the operation of controls is clear. 

        * Monitor your controls compliance real-time, so you do not have to wait
        and rely on the auditors alone to tell you whether or not you are
        compliant. 
          Use checklists within the controls management functionality to ensure that control operators are performing each essential part of key controls, especially "review" controls. 
        * Manage and monitor remediation of failed controls real-time
          Powerful, dynamic multi-dimensional reporting. Pre-built dashboards and reports, see standing of controls by location, regulatory requirement, vendor or system profile, control domain, etc. Build you own custom reports
        * Fully configurable. Each organization has different needs when it
        comes to controls management. It is easy to add new fields, add to or
        change the functionality according to your organizations' needs

      text: >-
        * Data Privacy laws are becoming ever more complex as each jurisdiction
        puts their own version of data privacy laws and consequences for
        breaches in place. Just check out the latest Baker McKenzie 2018 Global
        Privacy Handbook which outlines requirements of laws in more than 50
        countries, including GDPR, California state law, HIPAA, Privacy Shield,
        etc. 

        * In order to avoid prosecution, fines and penalties, it is critical
        that controls are operating effectively to ensure that only those
        authorized are able to see personal data, sensitive personal data,
        employee personal data, data belonging to minors, etc. 
          It is also important to track the handling of any potential data privacy incidents and perform Privacy Impact Assessments as appropriate for system and process changes. (Functionality coming soon, or quickly build your own)
        * Powerful, dynamic multi-dimensional reporting. Pre-built dashboards
        and reports, see standing of controls by location, regulatory
        requirement, vendor or system profile, control domain, etc. Build you
        own custom reports

        * Fully configurable. Each organization has different needs when it
        comes to controls management. It is easy to add new fields, add to or
        change the functionality according to your organizations' needs
    - title: PCI DSS
      image: /img/undraw_security_o890.png
      text: >-
        * PCI compliance is not easy to achieve with the breadth of more than
        200 required controls. 

        * Monitor your controls compliance real-time, so you do not have to wait
        and rely on the ISA or QSA assessors alone to tell you whether or not
        you are compliant. 

        * Use checklists within the controls management functionality to ensure
        that control operators are performing each essential part of key
        controls

        * Additionally it is important to track the monitoring of POS devices
        for tampering. This can be a monumental task and difficult to manage,
        but can be monitored easily using SMACK GRC

        * Powerful, dynamic multi-dimensional reporting. Pre-built dashboards
        and reports, see standing of controls by location, regulatory
        requirement, vendor or system profile, control domain, etc. Build you
        own custom reports

        * Fully configurable. Each organization has different needs when it
        comes to controls management. It is easy to add new fields, add to or

        * Keeping track of the existence and operation of cyber controls has
        never been more important. 

        * Use the Controls Assessment functionality to gather information from
        3rd parties and internal control owners alike to get an efficient view
        of the cyber security control environment. This entails setting up the
        assessment and then sending the assessment to the persons responsible
        for the operation of those controls. Upon completion the assessment can
        then be reviewed by internal cyber security personnel to gain any
        additional understanding required. 

        * Powerful, dynamic multi-dimensional reporting. Pre-built dashboards
        and reports, see standing of controls by location, Cyber Control Area
        (NIST, ISO27k, etc.), regulatory requirement, vendor or system profile,
        control domain, etc. Build you own custom reports

        * Fully configurable. Each organization has different needs when it
        comes to controls assessments. It is easy to add new fields, add to or
        change the functionality according to your organizations' needs
